                Road safety is not just a regulation â€” it is a responsibility we all share. Every life lost on the road is a tragedy that could have been prevented. With this project, our mission is to bring awareness, discipline, and technology together to save lives and create safer roads for everyone.
              </p>

              <p>
                I firmly believe that small changes in behavior, like wearing seatbelts, avoiding distractions, and respecting traffic rules, can make a big difference. Through innovation, collaboration, and continuous awareness, we aim to reduce accidents and ensure that every journey ends safely.
              </p>

              <p>
                This initiative is not just about preventing crashes, but about building a culture of responsibility and care. Together, let us move towards a future where road safety is a habit, not a choice.
